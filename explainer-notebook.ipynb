    "## Problem statement (Goal for end user)\n",
    "\n",
    "People are already aware of the general story on overfishing, even Netflix has jumped the bandwagon and produced documentaries such as _Seaspiracy_. However, such documentaries seem to mislead the audience [ref](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/31/seaspiracy-netflix-documentary-accused-of-misrepresentation-by-participants) due to over-dramatization. Moreover, most people think of fish as bad for the environment and our world sustainability goals, so they tend to avoid them all together, for example by becoming a vegetarian or vegan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> What we aim to show, is a sound and objective analysis of unsustainable fishing activities. Providing insights into the best and worst ways of the fishing industry by analysing two particularly interesting countries: China and Norway. Finally, using our analysis, we discuss whether eating fish is a viable option for steady protein supply.\n",

    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of datasets, we use a wide variety of different datasets to compose our story.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FAO\n",
    "\n",
    "The **main** source of data is from _Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations_ at the url [https://www.fao.org/home/en](https://www.fao.org/home/en). The organization provides access to a massive database with anything related to food and agricultural data in the world.\n",
    "Our requirements for the dataset was to have data for most countries (and further on, only Norway and China), some temporal information (years) and come from a credible source.\n",
    "This yielded the datasets from FAO:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fishing industry (import, export, supply, production)\n",
    "- Fish and seafood consumption per capita\n",
    "- Sources of consumed protein\n",
    "- Fishing methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source of data was the world bank [https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712)\n",
    "This gave access to the trend and development of open-ocean fishing versus aquacultural fishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we were able to get information on the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emission of aquacultural fishing from [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03889-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03889-2)\n",
    "### Descriptive data\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also made use of other third-party datasets that made it easier for us to gather information on a country's GDP and population each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to join this descriptive data with the main datasets, we had to find a common connection between them. Going by just the country name is risky as some countries go by more than one name and others simply have different spellings. Therefore, we used the country ISO-3 code that is _the_ standard for identifying countries. By merging this mapping onto any dataset using the country name (and making a few manual changes). We were able to get an ISO-3 standardized country code for each dataset that needed to be merged with other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another addition to the descriptive data is the use of a **geojson** file that is used for the choropleth maps. However, the original file was too complex (too many polygons) and therefore took a lot of time to plot and render. We therefore decided to simplify the geojson using an online tool such that we ensure that we maintain interpretability and a high enough resolution for the polygons to overlap correctly with the country borders."

    "## Why did we choose these datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing datasets for this project was not easy as it's difficult to find data that covers information on specific fishing related topics such as fishing gear, emission of aquacultural fish, protein supply for each country and so on. Even more so, it was painful to find data with a temporal aspect over multiple years. This resulted in us fetching data from many different sources after searching through a large amount of infeasible datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that the selected datasets are useful because they are a combination of being rich in information (covers many metrics over many countries with few NaN values), covering multiple years of data, cover extremely niche or rare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the datasets provide us with an opportunity to explore overfishing on a global scope as well as diving into the specific methods of China and Norway. Moreover, they also contain information on eating habits in terms of protein supply which helps in analysing both the behaviour of the population and the demand of fish."

    "Our story is told through a sequence of topics that each contribute to a developing story where initially the reader is presented to a broad subject but guided towards a specific conclusion towards the end. This way of telling a story is primarily author-driven and fits the magazine style genre. Due to the author-driven nature of this genre, we realized that we had to make the layout of the website pleasing to look at whilst communicating the results efficiently and keeping the reader engaged. This shifted our focus to adopting some more reader-driven approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, our data is indeed very complex as it originates from 11 different files and covers a wide variety of perspectives all from global fishing industries to greenhouse gas emissions from farmed agricultural fish. Therefore, to balance the author-driven and reader-driven aspects, we have taken inspiration from the \"Interactive Slideshow\" which emphasizes that complex datasets is often well-suited for this format, as _it allows the author to draw discrete boundaries between story segments_.\n"

    "* **Progress Bar / Timebar**\n",
    "* **Consistent Visual Platform**\n",
    "\n",
    "We made use of the progress bar as it gives the reader a nice way of interacting with the graph and seeing the development over time. We chose to go with a consistent visual platform to make the aesthetics feel more connected and in a flow, which would also help guide the flow of the content (story). This can be seen in using the same color scheme across all plots and also using the same plotting backend (plotly). Having too many inconsistencies can result in disorientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlighting\n",
    "* **Feature Distinction**\n",
    "\n",
    "We make use of feature distinction because it clearly showcases where and what the reader should be trying to look at or interact with. For example, the reader is initially met with\n",
    "a section of \"Tabs\" that indicate a slight blue color when hovered over, telling the reader to click each tab. Then under the \"Industry\" tab, colors are used to highlight four buttons that describe different areas of the fishing industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Guidance\n",
    "* **Familiar Objects**\n",
    "* **Object Continuity**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition guidance is important to make sure the reader feels compelled to continue reading the story. There are a bunch of strategies that one can use, for example encourage the use of reader-driven designs. Another strategy is to make the transition between content smooth and seamless. Since the magazine style genre is inherently linear, we try our best to create a more encouring journey through our story by using the transition guidance principles. For this reason, we chose to focus a lot on Familiar Objects and Object Continuity. We ensure this by creating plots that originate from the same backend (plotly), using the same color schemes (`\n",
    "_plot` decorator), and roughly the same font and sizes. Whilst all being structured in the familiar two column layout with a few exceptions to keep the design from being too repetitive."

    "\n",
    "1. Ordering\n",
    "2. Interactivity\n",
    "3. Messaging\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordering (1) is concerned on which path the reader can take through the narrative, such as a linear (author-driven) path, user-chosen or a random path. The interactivity (2) is concerned about ways that the reader can select, search and navigate each visualization, and also how the reader learns about these interactions. The final section, messaging (3) is about the ways a visualization communicates observations and results to the reader."

    "As the story tries to follow the Interactive Slideshow format, it is primarily a linear path that the reader is forced to take. However, in the absolute beginning of the story we try to let the reader make some choices by viewing the different tabs. Each tab will then present some accompanying text to describe the plot. This will make the path seem less linear whilst still ensuring that the reader will progress naturally to the next chapter below once all tabs have been explored.\n",

    "In terms of interactivty, all the plots have the option to provide more detailed information when hovering. Moreover, the filtering and selection functionalities have been implemented as the reader can optionally add or remove groups from plots, and also zoom in / select specific points of the plots that they want to further enhance. This ensures that each chapter has some sort of depth to it (additional information can be retrieved by interacting with the plots), and in turn reduces the static feel of the magazine genre. However, this is hard to enforce when we also have to make sure that the reader does not get lost in the different datasets.\n",

However, the reader must be guided to some extent as the authors argue is a property of an \"Interactive Slideshow\". Therefore, we provide captions and headlines for each section while annotating some plots where necessary (trend lines). Moreover, every plot has an accompanying article as much of the information can only be explained by associating the plots with our research, such as what effect Phosphorous and Nitrogen has on the ocean environments.\n"

Our story starts from a birds-eye view of the problem and has yet to dive into Norway and China specifically. The best way to give the reader this birds-eye overview is to do exactly that: give them a birds-eye overview.

    "Line and trendline plots are used to show how factors such as average global fish consumption and fish production types develop over time, either individually or by comparing development across groups. Given the nature of line plots, it's intuitive for the reader to have time as an x-axis component and a variable on the y-axis. Different colors on the graph can indicate multiple groups within the same year, or the existence of a trend such as the average global fish consumption trend.\n",

    "Interestingly, the GDP vs consumption plot differs from the other line and trendline plots in terms of what is on the axis. In this plot, we use the two variables: GDP per capita and consumption (kg / capita) as axes. Moreover, an overall trend is used along with a textbox of the Pearson-Spearman correlation to truly emphasise and communicate the correlation between GDP and seafood consumption. Finally, we separate the points by nation (China vs Norway) to further show where the two countries lie on the trend.\n",

The first example is the 'Overfishing' tab which shows an area plot of global overexploited fishing vs sustainable fishing. Of course the sum of those should always be 100% which is why we use the area beneath the curve to show that the sum across variables add to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is repeated for the 'Fishing Methods' section where the two area plots show the proportion of each fishing method. The area plots are similar to line plots in the way that they are both essentially lines and has an intuitive interpretation with time on the x-axis. However, the area plots are better at showing proportions of groups. Which is very similar to a vertical stacked bar chart. We chose to maintain the area plot for the fishing methods as it has good aesthetics without losing the message (clearly more bottom trawling in China) and most importantly; we are able to intuitively add a time-dimension."

This plot highlights the worst protein sources in terms of GHG emissions by showing how Beef and Lamb & Goat compare to other protein sources. Moreover, it also shows how little Fish and Seafood emits compared to the other sources. And due to plotly's interactivity, the reader can deselect the Beef group and look at how the groups compare without such a significant outlier. We deem that these insights are best communicated in a vertical bar plot.\n",

It shows the distribution of protein from 0% to 100%, and since it's important to highlight how the countries compare, we chose to make the plot horizontal, as that will lead to a more natural direction of reading (left to right). In addition, by having the bars stacked on top of each other it is visually much easier to compare them. We believe that this layout makes the reader infer the differences between two countrys' protein sources, as seamlessly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second horizontal bar plot is slightly different as there are more groups to compare and the fact that they do not function as smaller components of one whole. Instead, the plots highlights how much GHG each farmed species emits per kg of edible weight. Chicken is included here as a baseline comparison, as it's known to be more environmental friendly than most alternatives. This plot is horizontal due to us wanting to highlight _negative_ emissions from the Seaweed and Bivalves species, this is yet again best shown horizontally, as we should find the negative values first due to reading left to right. Moreover, each bar consists of both the Nitrogen and Phosphorous emissions which serves as an extra comparison between which GHG each species emits."

    "Finally, we discuss the overall process and the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the things that went well. Considering the vast amount of data, we believe that the true key points have been extracted from each dataset to create a story that teaches the reader something about where overfishing takes place, how it damages the environment and how the industry can be more sustainable. The plots used in the website all follow the same theme, are easy to read and have a general aesthetic pleasing look to them. Moreover, the website itself is filled with small details such as a nice but subtle background with a turtle (:turtle:), a navigation bar that follows you around the page so you can always jump around, and other things such as making use of markdown language to highlight quotes, create titles and mark words in bold or italic. Moreover, given that the topic is difficult to generate something novel from, we find that the angle on emissions with respect to what they eat, and also how the two countries farm the fish, provides insights that have not been discussed much before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to what could've been improved. First of all, if not obvious by now, we would've chosen a smaller dataset, preferably 1 or 2 with many columns that can be engineered in different ways to create novel insights or facilitate some more advanced machine learning that fitting a regression line. Moreover, the many datasets come as a consequence of having a very broad topic that was initially difficult to narrow down to a completely clear story. Much of our time was spent jumping through datasets and spending hours analysing them only to find out that they were not really valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having a more narrow scope and smaller dataset, it would've been easier to guide the reader and create a seamless flow in the story. Perhaps less complexity in the story would have lead to more creative plotting techniques that would not require accompanying text.\n"
